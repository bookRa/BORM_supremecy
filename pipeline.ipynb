He is part of the family unit attending the lottery.4. **Mr. Summers**: Described as a round-faced, jovial man. He has considerable time and energy to devote to civic activities and runs the coal business. People feel sorry for him because he has no children and his wife is described as a scold.

The community seems traditional, with defined gender roles, as women join their husbands, and children are reluctantly called in by their parents.\n",
